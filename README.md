## Technologies 🔥

I used React JS and MUI (for implementing design) to create this project. React has great 
documentations and it's easy to learn. Many companies are using it on their applications 
because it's great, fast, and trending. React also has a huge support community.


## Objective‼

The objective is to help job applicants find remote jobs from different parts of the world 🌎.
Job requirements, skills, salaries, and other helpful informations can be access on this application.

## Features ✨

This application retrieves data from a third party Web API. These datas are used to
create a section where job applicants can search by typing job positions, location,
or keywords. Searching jobs based on categories is also available for the applicants. 
Using the field categories along with job types such as 'full-time' or 'part-time' work
make job search easier.


## Key Learnings from this project: 👨‍🎓
## 1️⃣ Context API:
  The use of Context API was great and efficient. When I started this
project I was funneling datas from one component to another.
Sometimes, it had to go through a components that doesn't even need it.
It can be frustating and confusing at times from all the unnecessary data being passed around.
Luckily, I found a better way by the use of Context API.


## 2️⃣ Filtering Datas
  Filtering Data was pretty common, but filtering datas from another
filtered data and be able to go back to previous filtered data was challenging for me💆‍♂️ .
Implementing multiple filtering functionalities on this application was a great learning experience. 

## Features for the Future 💯💯
✅ Adding a Recent Search feature on this application would be great. This feature would allow
users to see their previous search details such as dates, company names, or keywords.

✅ Applicant Postings for potentials employers or recruiters to see and contact job applicants.
